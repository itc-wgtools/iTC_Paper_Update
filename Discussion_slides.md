% CCDB-CCUF Discussion - refining the iTC Process Document
%  September 2019
% David Martin / Brian Wood



# Why do this?

- Document ("Establishing iTCs and cPP development ") has never been formally approved
- Many requests to update (from CCDB and from users)
- Document already included steps to help learning from initial use (that were expected to be removed later - this has never been done)
- Now is a particularly good time because:-
  - There are a number of iTCs created, or being created
  - Original paper does not cover the maintenance aspects
  - The CCUF tools group has produced some very efficient ways of creating and managing iTCs, cPP, and SDs. These would be further improved by making the overall process more efficient and effective. 
  - CCDB suggestion in Rome to reduce requirements around iTC creation 
  - CCUF (including iTC chairs) discussion paper

# Discussion aims

- This is an informal discussion - not making decisions
- But should be a useful initial discussion to guide the work
- Full review of updated document will take place before any adoption/publication
- Timescale to be agreed
- Aim here is to:  
	- Identify any major principles to be used (e.g. fundamental CCRA responsibilities )
	- Identify possible changes 
	- Identify areas where more information may be needed before making changes.

Break to present an overview of the work


# Outstanding CCUF question ITC.03: - 1

"At the moment the documentation reads that any cPP must undergo a full evaluation by a lab before being approved. This would seem to imply that the first vendor gets stuck with the cost of doing a cPP evaluation at the same time as their product evaluation, potentially to a changing cPP target if issues are found. It is not clear to me, that in the commercial world this is really an acceptable method. It puts the first vendor at a cost and speed disadvantage to get a product out that is certified (and every vendor that follows is able to avoid both the cPP eval cost and the time for it). It would seem that coordination to split the costs or arrangements to switch the first vendor (i.e. I go first now, vendor 2 goes first on the next update, etc) are likely to run afoul of competition/collusion laws (not to mention simple market dynamics). 

# Outstanding CCUF question ITC.03: - 2

It doesn't seem like this was thought through for commercial products in an open market, but for GOTS products (at best), in a specific market. My expectation is that since at least 2 schemes are sponsoring any iTC, that there should be an implicit approval of the cPPs that are produced by the group since there is ample time during the creation process for a review of the cPP at this time. I would like to know why this isn't the expectation going forward and since it isn't, how exactly the CCDB expects the approval of cPPs to occur in the competitive, commercial marketplace."



# Outstanding CCUF question ITC.03: - Response

Addressed by the new cPP/SD initial approval on first use backed up by CCMB review process  

# Outstanding CCUF question ITC.04: - 1

A follow-on to question ITC.03 – can the CCDB make the PP-Module approval process more lightweight?

Background: It seems that building PP-Modules will cause a lot of extra hassle due to the explicit approvals and requirements for linking them with cPPs. While I certainly understand that a PP-Module could potentially introduce conflict with a cPP, the method for ensuring their use in the combined PPs (i.e. a cPP and any additional PP-Modules) require not only the coordination of multiple groups (potentially) but the separate approval and evaluation of the combined PP (which would seem to entail again a complete, first vendor evaluation of the combined PP) and the documents coordinating the linkage are ones that require full iTC approval (as opposed to supporting documents which can be updated as needed, these are full spec-level docs that require scheme approval). 

# Outstanding CCUF question ITC.04: - 2

It almost looks better to just write a new cPP instead of trying to write reusable modules. I would like to know the thinking of the CCDB about the process and how they actually expect this to work in the commercial world where products change rapidly and where the concept of reusable PP-Modules seemingly provides huge benefits.

# Outstanding CCUF question ITC.04: - Response

To be considered in the iTC process document update.


# CCUF iTC Chairs' discussion paper -1

- Process for public review only needed for cPP/SD?

-Some steps could be condensed?

- “iTC adjudicates comments as necessary” could simply be a loop back instead of its own numbered box
- “iTC creates [document]” could be “iTC” begins work”

# CCUF iTC Chairs' discussion paper -2

- Can there be a process for taking existing PP written by TC?
   - Present end product for endorsement/approval? 
   - CCDB is provided the ESR, TOR, structure of iTC, draft cPP, etc.
   - CCDB checks at end and approve or not
   - Provisional status for a cPP
   - Scheme involvement non-binary, allowing interim recognition?

# CCUF iTC Chairs' discussion paper -3
- Regular updates instead of scheme sponsorship?
- Formal notification to CCDB of standup
- CCDB acknowledges and expects regular status updates
- Change most approvals to checkpoints and iTC proceeds to next step unless a scheme objects
- TC must be open and meet expectations of iTCs. Must have criteria, published.

# Suggested discussion approach

- Following slides make suggestions of changes or areas to consider
- Ordered as in diagram (but could be done in ease/priority order instead?)
- Most important ones are highlighted
- Discuss each highlighted question in turn
- Notes will be kept and used in the drafting of an update
- Finally discuss way forward and likely timescales

# The big questions

## What level of control do CCDB/MC need?

* The CCRA requires the MC approval of iTC 
  * Approval requires some due diligence (at least review of adherence to WTO TBT principles ) 
  * To change this would require reopening of CCRA
  * If needed however we could make suggestions for any later update of CCRA?

* How many iTCs do we expect to need to handle?

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-1

* QUESTION: Does the creation of iTCs and subsequent production of cPPs/SDs need to involve the CCRA committees?
* QUESTION: Does the CCDB/MC agree that we now have enough experience to reduce the constraints (even if this is done gradually)?
* **QUESTION: ** Can others now act as initiators of an iTC (e.g. industry as suggested at the recent CCDB meeting in Rome? Should there be any constraints imposed on who/how many and what should the process be (if CCDB/MC is still involved at some stage) 

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-2

*  QUESTION: Not many participants have been involved so far - can we identify the reason(s) and make improvements? 
*  **QUESTION:** What about the position statement and endorsement process - can that be changed/improved?
*  QUESTION: Suggested in Rome that industry should be able to create iTCs without needing a supporting CCRA Participant - is it time to allow this?
*  **QUESTION:** Recent iTCs have produced the ESRs without a CCDB WG - should we remove the requirement for a WG?

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-3

* **QUESTION:** Approval by DB and endorsement by MC is an essential requirement - assuming no one wants to re-open CCRA - how do we make the process as efficient as possible?
*  **QUESTION:** The use of an interpretations group has been found useful by a number of iTCs and is part of the tools group support information - should it be included here?
*  QUESTION: Are there any "other bodies involved in policy making, standardization, or procurement" that could be identified and invited to be involved in endorsement (ISO?, ETSI, NATO?)

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-4

* **QUESTION:** To make the position/endorsement process easier should there be templates produced by the tools group?
* QUESTION: Should position and endorsement positions be shown on iTC pages or on portal?
* **QUESTION:** Should collection of these statements now be an iTC responsibility?

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-5

* QUESTION: Should position and endorsement positions be shown on iTC pages or on portal?
* QUESTION: Suggested in Rome that industry should be able to create iTCs without needing a supporting CCRA Participant - is it time to allow this?
* **QUESTION:** Is it now time to allow other requirements (not only government) in the ESR and remove need for a WG?

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-6
* QUESTION: Discussion needed regarding CCDB role in the case of overlaps and/or where there is no direct Participant interest in an industry suggested iTC?
* QUESTION: Remove the need for a WG (or identify it as a pre-iTC step without the requirement for Participant involvement)?
* QUESTION: Is it now time to allow other requirements (not only government) in the ESR and remove need for a WG?
* QUESTION: Block 9/10/11 will need to change if we remove need for a WG.

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-7
* QUESTION: Consider how many iTCs the CCDB could usefully coordinate?
* **QUESTION:** How to appoint a CCDB Liaison where no Participant interest has been identified (fairly allocated from a list?) 
* QUESTION: Re-write Block 13 for the most likely case of pre-iTC/WG produces ESR etc. 
* **QUESTION:** Does the SPD need public review as well as the cPP and SDs?   

# Detailed Questions (incomplete)-8
* QUESTION: The maintenance document was never produced - we now have some relevant experience (NIT etc.) Should we just incorporate in this document?. 
* QUESTION: Does the CCMC operating procedure need to be changed
* **QUESTION:** Discuss how to identify and handle inactive iTCs?
