% CCDB-CCUF Discussion
%  September 2019
% David Martin 



# Why do this?

- Document has never been formally approved
- Many requests to update (from CCDB and users)
- Included steps to help learning from initial use (that were expected to be removed later - this has never been done)
- Now is a good time because:-
  - There are over x iTCs created or being created
  - The CCUF tools group has produced very efficient ways of creating and managing iTCs, cPP, and SDs. These would be further improved by making the overall process more efficient and effective.  

# Discussion aims

- Initial discussion to guide the work
- Full review of updated document before adoption
- Timescale to be agreed
- Identify possible changes 
- Identify areas where more information may help

# Suggested process

- Following slides make suggestions of changes or areas to consider
- Ordered as in diagram (but could be done in ease/priority order instead?)
- Discuss each in turn
- Notes will be kept and circulated afterwards
- Finally discuss way forward and likely timescales

# The big questions

## What level of control do CCDB/MC need?

- The CCRA requires MC approval of iTC (assume we don't want to reopen CCRA?!)
- Current process 

## How many iTCs do we expect to need to handle?
